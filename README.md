<h1>This is the Repo Where I am learning about the Various Node js JS Modules</h1>
<h2>Post Man- </h2> <p>   Postman(https://www.postman.com/) is a comprehensive platform for API development that allows you to design, create, and test APIs. It's particularly known for its user-friendly interface, extensive features, and the ability to create and run test scripts for APIs</p>
<h2>NodeMon-</h2>
<p>Nodemon is a command-line tool that helps with the speedy development of Node. js applications. It monitors your project directory and automatically restarts your node application when it detects any changes. This means that you do not have to stop and restart your applications in order for your changes to take effect.</p>

<h2>FS Module-</h2>
<p>The built-in Node.js file system module helps us store, access, and manage data on our operating system. Commonly used features of the fs module include fs.readFile to read data from a file, fs.writeFile to write data to a file and replace the file if it already exists, fs.watchFile to get notified of changes, and fs.appendFile to append data to a file. The fs core module is available in every Node.js project without having to install it.</p>

<h2>OS Module</h2>
<p>The os module is a built-in Nodejs module that is used to get information about a computerâ€™s operating system. In other words, the os module provides operating system-related utility methods and properties.</p>
